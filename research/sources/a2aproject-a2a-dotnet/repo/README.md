[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/A2A.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/A2A/)

A .NET library that helps run agentic applications as A2AServers following the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org).

The A2A .NET SDK provides a robust implementation of the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and applications. This library offers both high-level abstractions and fine-grained control, making it easy to build A2A-compatible agents while maintaining flexibility for advanced use cases.

Key features include:
- **Agent Capability Discovery**: Retrieve agent capabilities and metadata through agent cards
- **Message-based Communication**: Direct, stateless messaging with immediate responses
- **Task-based Communication**: Create and manage persistent, long-running agent tasks
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time communication using Server-Sent Events
- **ASP.NET Core Integration**: Built-in extensions for hosting A2A agents in web applications
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Supports .NET 8+

## Protocol Compatibility

This library implements the [A2A v1.0 specification](https://a2a-protocol.org). It provides full support for the JSON-RPC binding and HTTP+JSON REST binding, including streaming via Server-Sent Events.

If you're upgrading from the v0.3 SDK, see the **[Migration Guide](docs/migration-guide-v1.md)** for a comprehensive list of breaking changes and before/after code examples. A backward-compatible `A2A.V0_3` NuGet package is available during the transition:

```bash
dotnet add package A2A.V0_3
```

## Installation

### Core A2A Library

```bash
dotnet add package A2A
```

### ASP.NET Core Extensions

```bash
dotnet add package A2A.AspNetCore
```

## Overview
![alt text](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-dotnet/raw/main/overview.png)

## Library: A2A
This library contains the core A2A protocol implementation. It includes the following key classes:

### Client Classes
- **`A2AClient`**: Primary client for making A2A requests to agents. Supports both streaming and non-streaming communication, task management, and push notifications.
- **`A2ACardResolver`**: Resolves agent card information from A2A-compatible endpoints to discover agent capabilities and metadata.

### Server Classes  
- **`TaskManager`**: Manages the complete lifecycle of agent tasks including creation, updates, cancellation, and event streaming. Handles both message-based and task-based communication patterns.
- **`ITaskStore`**: An interface for abstracting the storage of tasks.
- **`InMemoryTaskStore`**: Simple in-memory implementation of `ITaskStore` suitable for development and testing scenarios.

### Core Models
- **`AgentTask`**: Represents a task with its status, history, artifacts, and metadata.
- **`AgentCard`**: Contains agent metadata, capabilities, and endpoint information.
- **`Message`**: Represents messages exchanged between agents and clients.

## Library: A2A.AspNetCore
This library provides ASP.NET Core integration for hosting A2A agents. It includes the following key classes:

### Extension Methods
- **`A2ARouteBuilderExtensions`**: Provides `MapA2A()` and `MapHttpA2A()` extension methods for configuring A2A endpoints in ASP.NET Core applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Agent Server

```csharp
using A2A;
using A2A.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

var store = new InMemoryTaskStore();
var taskManager = new TaskManager(store);

taskManager.OnSendMessage = async (request, ct) =>
{
    var text = request.Message.Parts.FirstOrDefault()?.Text ?? "";
    return new SendMessageResponse
    {
        Message = new Message
        {
            MessageId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N"),
            Role = Role.Agent,
            Parts = [Part.FromText($"Echo: {text}")]
        }
    };
};

var agentCard = new AgentCard
{
    Name = "Echo Agent",
    Description = "Echoes messages back to the user",
    Version = "1.0.0",
    SupportedInterfaces = [new AgentInterface
    {
        Url = "http://localhost:5000/echo",
        ProtocolBinding = "JSONRPC",
        ProtocolVersion = "1.0"
    }],
    DefaultInputModes = ["text/plain"],
    DefaultOutputModes = ["text/plain"],
    Capabilities = new AgentCapabilities { Streaming = false },
    Skills = [new AgentSkill
    {
        Id = "echo",
        Name = "Echo",
        Description = "Echoes back user messages",
        Tags = ["echo"]
    }],
};

app.MapA2A(taskManager, "/echo");
app.MapWellKnownAgentCard(agentCard);
app.Run();
```

### 2. Connect with A2AClient

```csharp
using A2A;

// Discover agent
var cardResolver = new A2ACardResolver(new Uri("http://localhost:5000/"));
var agentCard = await cardResolver.GetAgentCardAsync();

// Create client using agent's endpoint
var client = new A2AClient(new Uri(agentCard.SupportedInterfaces[0].Url));

// Send message
var response = await client.SendMessageAsync(new SendMessageRequest
{
    Message = new Message
    {
        MessageId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N"),
        Role = Role.User,
        Parts = [Part.FromText("Hello!")]
    }
});

// Handle response
switch (response.PayloadCase)
{
    case SendMessageResponseCase.Message:
        Console.WriteLine(response.Message!.Parts[0].Text);
        break;
    case SendMessageResponseCase.Task:
        Console.WriteLine($"Task created: {response.Task!.Id}");
        break;
}
```
